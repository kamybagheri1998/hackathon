#### 1.1.1: DIY Problem Definition
What is the key issue you are tying to address and why is it important?\
Due to socio-economic inequalities, acquiring the hardware nescessary for education in the modern and increasingly digitalized world is not viable for every student.
As a consequence, there is a limited chance of obtaining an optimal education.
Solving this problem is important beacause it is nescessary to enable equal access to education for every studnet to move towards a more equal world.\
\
Who is it a problem for?\
Students from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds.\
\
What evidence do you have that this is worth the investment?\
There are many ways that a lack of hardware presents itself in the modern world.
One big result of the lack of access to quality and digital education is the lack of qualified experts in the field of IT.
Furthermore, lacking hardware hinders the development of homeschooling opportunities.\
\
Can you think of this problem in a different way? Can you reframe it?\
In order to ensure an equal and inclusive society, the opportinuties must be equal for all students, regardless of background. 
Without a means of accessing or centralizing the freely available resources, those of disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds will have inequal access to modern, quality education.\
