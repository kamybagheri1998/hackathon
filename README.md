#### 1.1.1: DIY Problem Definition

**What is the key issue you are trying to address and why is it important?**\
Due to socio-economic inequalities, acquiring the hardware necessary for education in the modern and increasingly digitalized world is not viable for every student.
As a consequence, there is a limited chance of obtaining an optimal education.
Solving this problem is important because it is necessary to enable equal access to education for every student to move towards a more equal world.\
\
**Who is it a problem for?**\
Students from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds.\
\
**What social/cultural factors shape this problem?**\
This problem is shaped by the income and assets of the family.
Families of a less fortunate background have less access to hardware.\
\
**What evidence do you have that this is worth the investment?**\
There are many ways that a lack of hardware presents itself in the modern world.
One big problem resulting from inadequate access to quality and digital education is the lack of qualified experts in the field of IT.
Furthermore, lacking hardware hinders the development of homeschooling opportunities.\
\
**Can you think of this problem in a different way? Can you re-frame it?**\
In order to ensure an equal and inclusive society, the opportunities must be equal for all students, regardless of background.
Without a means of accessing or centralizing the freely available resources, those of disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds will have unequal access to modern, quality education.

### 1.2: Peer Feedback

Our peer group provided the following feedback:

- Good design.
- More personas could be considered.
- Lack of technical know-how should be considered as an aspect/cause.
We immediately noticed your very attractive portfolio. We found it to be clearly designed and modern. We think your theme is contemporary and important. We would like to see one more exemplary person. We had the impression that you had a special target group in mind. You have worked out the problem of low hardware for students with low income very well. 
We feel that the problem has not yet been fully thought through. In our opinion, another persona/target group would give you a new perspective on the problem as an example. We liked how we could discuss this in our common conversation. 
In general, we think you guys have come up with a solid problem. Now we hope that you think about the necessary steps, such as: resetting the laptops and PCs, that the organization is regulated by the schools and whether the procurement of the devices is sufficient if the students can not operate them because there are no teachers who are trained.
