#### 1.1.1: DIY Problem Definition 3.0

**What is the key issue you are trying to address and why is it important?**\
The key issue we are trying to address unequal access to hardware.\
We see this issue as the main roadblock keeping students at every level
of education from benefiting fully from modern technologies in education,
such as digital and interactive media, game-based and gamified education, 
digital learning platforms, and interactive video communication applications.\
Such technologies have the potential to make education more efficient, effective, and individual by
providing students with a more interactive, engaging, and personal learning experience while also
accelerating group collaboration and growing the critical social and technical skills needed in many modern occupations.
These methods can help teachers and administrators teach, organize, and interact with their students faster and more effectively. 
Moreover, they may enable parents to better track their children's progress and get feedback from their teachers.
\
**Who is it a problem for?**\
This issue impacts:

- Students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds
- Teachers
- Parents

\
**What social/cultural factors shape this problem?**\
This problem is shaped by:

_Socio-economic background._
A disadvantaged socio-economic background may prevent students and parents from financing necessary or desired hardware.

_Socio-cultural background._
Lacking access to hardware can hinder students in socialization in the personal and educational context
and may even lead to social ostracization of students by their peers.

\
**What evidence do you have that this is worth the investment?**\
One of the most evident consequences of lacking IT know-how is the
well-known skilled worker shortage in Germany. As reported by the [tagesschau](https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/it-berufe-fachkraftemangel-rekord-100.html),
almost 68000 IT jobs remain unfilled. If students had earlier and more substantial
access to hardware, such shortages may not have occurred.

\
**Can you think of this problem in a different way? Can you re-frame it?**

Children from disadvantaged backgrounds have limited opportunities to socialize,
especially in the digital realm, where gaming in Fortnite becomes an important cornerstone
in every youth's afternoon. By providing the youth with the hardware they
lack, they will be able to socialize in modern mediums such as Gaming, reducing their
social exclusion due to their socio-economic status.

### 1.2: Peer Feedback

Our peer group provided the following feedback:

- Good design.
- More personas could be considered.
- Lack of technical know-how should be considered as an aspect/cause.

We immediately noticed your very attractive portfolio. We found it to be clearly designed and modern. We think your theme is contemporary and important. We would like to see one more exemplary person. We had the impression that you had a special target group in mind. You have worked out the problem of low hardware for students with low income very well. 
We feel that the problem has not yet been fully thought through. In our opinion, another persona/target group would give you a new perspective on the problem as an example. We liked how we could discuss this in our common conversation. 
In general, we think you guys have come up with a solid problem. Now we hope that you think about the necessary steps, such as: resetting the laptops and PCs, that the organization is regulated by the schools and whether the procurement of the devices is sufficient if the students can not operate them because there are no teachers who are trained.
